Asynchronous Python client for Net2Grid devices.

## About

A python package with which you can read the data from a [NET2GRID][net2grid] device via a local api. Net2Grid supplies energy hardware to brands, that can market it as a white label product.

## Supported SmartBridges

- SBWF3102 ([Pure Energie][pure-energie])

## Installation

```bash
pip install gridnet
```

## Usage

```py
import asyncio

from gridnet import GridNet

async def main():
    """Show example on getting data from your device."""
    async with GridNet(
        host="127.0.0.1",
    ) as client:
        device = await client.device()
        smartbridge = await client.smartbridge()
        print(device)
        print(smartbridge)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Data

You can read the following data with this package, the `power flow` entity can also give a negative value. The `energy` entities are total values of both low and high tariff together.

### Device

- ID
- Model
- Batch
- Firmware version
- Hardware version
- Manufacturer

### SmartBridge

- Power Flow (W)
- Energy Consumption (kWh)
- Energy Production (kWh)

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager.

You need at least:

- Python 3.9+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
