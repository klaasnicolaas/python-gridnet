Asynchronous Python client for the Pure Energie Meter device.

## About

A python package with which you can read the data from your [Pure Energie Meter][pem] device via a local API, made by the company [Pure Energie][pure-energie]. With this device you can read your smart meter via the P1 serial port.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pure_energie
```

## Usage

```py
import asyncio

from pure_energie import PureEnergie

async def main():
    """Show example on getting data from your Pure Energie device."""
    async with PureEnergie(
        host="example.com",
    ) as client:
        device = await client.device()
        smartmeter = await client.smartmeter()
        print(device)
        print(smartmeter)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

## Data

You can read the following data with this package, the `power flow` entity can also give a negative value. The `energy` entities are total values of both low and high tariff together.

### Device

- ID
- Model
- Firmware version
- Manufacturer

### SmartMeter

- Power Flow (W)
- Energy Consumption (kWh)
- Energy Production (kWh)

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager.

You need at least:

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
